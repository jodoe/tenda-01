This is a script to poll live RSSI data from the AP to check alignment. The polling happens over TELNET, using a widely publised root password used for other Tenda devices.

To ensure the RSSI is constantly updated, have a ping running to the device in a seperate window. If no traffic travels over the link the RSSI information rarely updates on the AP.

When running, you can view the singal quality RSSI, TS and RX speeds and rough bar graph showing signal quality.
